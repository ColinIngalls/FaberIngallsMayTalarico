# Macaulay2 Package
Part of this project is a package for the computer algebra system Macaulay2. This can be installed locally by using the installPackage M2 method, and then loaded with loadPackage. There is WIP documentation which will be installed locally with the package. The CSS/JS, and so TEX does not work locally on my machine - From testing it seems that there's some funky file path issues with WSL. The generated hlmt points to the css and JS files but I think that the system can't find them.
